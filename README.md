# NSFW Character Prompt Generator

A comprehensive toolkit for generating optimized NSFW character prompts for various AI image generation models on CivitAI.

## Project Overview

This project provides detailed guides and templates for creating high-quality, consistent NSFW character prompts across multiple AI image generation model families, with specific optimization techniques for each model type.

> **Note:** This is a private repository containing adult content. Access is restricted to authorized users only.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Guides
- **`sd15_guide_consolidated.md`**: Complete guide for SD 1.5 prompt generation
- **`implementation_guide_consolidated.md`**: Comprehensive implementation instructions
- **`model_comparison_guide.md`**: Side-by-side comparison of all supported models
- **`perplexity_integration_guide.md`**: Integration workflow with Perplexity and CivitAI
- **`character_consistency_techniques.md`**: Methods for maintaining character consistency

### Example Conversations
The `conversation_logs/` directory contains example discussions with various AI assistants about character prompt generation:
- Claude conversations in `conversation_logs/claude/`
- Grok conversations in `conversation_logs/grok/`
- Gemini conversations in `conversation_logs/gemini/`
- Perplexity conversations in `conversation_logs/perplexity/`

### Implementation Framework
The `framework/` directory contains the implementation structure:
- Model-specific modules in `framework/models/`
- Character consistency tools in `framework/consistency/`
- Test cases in `framework/tests/`
- Utility functions in `framework/utils/`
- User interfaces in `framework/interfaces/`

## Usage Guide

1. Start with the `sd15_guide_consolidated.md` for SD 1.5 prompt generation
2. Read `model_comparison_guide.md` to understand model differences
3. Follow `implementation_guide_consolidated.md` for setup instructions
4. Use `perplexity_integration_guide.md` for workflow integration
5. Apply `character_consistency_techniques.md` for maintaining character identity

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- This tool is for creating NSFW content with fictional adult characters only
- Users must comply with platform terms of service
- Age verification is required for implementation
- Users are responsible for ensuring generated content is legal in their jurisdiction

## Development Status

This project is under active development. Future updates will include:
- Additional model-specific guides
- Enhanced character consistency tools
- Web-based user interface
- Integration with more AI image generation platforms
