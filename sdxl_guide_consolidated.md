## Key Optimization Techniques

### 1. Photographic Framing

SDXL excels with photography-style prompts:

### 2. Cinematic Quality

Enhance realism with film-inspired terminology:

- Use terms like "cinematic", "film still", "movie scene"
- Include lighting descriptors: "cinematic lighting", "dramatic lighting"
- Example: `(cinematic:1.2), (shallow depth of field:1.1), (film grain:0.5)`

### 3. Detail Enhancement

SDXL handles details well with proper guidance:

- Use terms like "intricate details", "highly detailed", "fine detail"
- Apply slightly higher weights to detail terms (1.1-1.3)
- Example: `(intricate details:1.2), (highly detailed skin:1.1), (detailed features:1.2)`

### 4. Realistic Styling

For photorealistic results:

- Include terms like "photorealistic", "hyperrealistic", "lifelike"
- Combine with resolution indicators: "8k", "high resolution"
- Example: `(photorealistic:1.3), (hyperdetailed:1.2), 8k`

### 5. Balanced Backgrounds

For full-body or environmental shots:

- Use lower weights for backgrounds (0.9-1.0)
